# StaticPool

A fixed size pool of objects with no dynamic memory allocation.
Provides validated access to its elements through opaque handles.

Inspired by [this blog article](https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html).

### `init(withSize size: Int)`
Creates a new pool with the given size
- *Parameters*:

### `add(_ item: T) throws -> Handle`
Inserts a new item in the first available slot.
- *Parameters*:

Gets the item in the slot pointed by the provided handle

    - `StaticPoolError.DanglingHandle`: If the handle doesn't match the current allocation of that slot

---

### `getReusableSlotCount() -> Int`
Returns the number of slots that can still be reused. If this gets to 0, you might want to consider resetting some slots.

---

### `reset(slot: Int)`
